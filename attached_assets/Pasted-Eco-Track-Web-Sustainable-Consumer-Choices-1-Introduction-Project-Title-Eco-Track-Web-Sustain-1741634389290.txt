Eco-Track Web - Sustainable Consumer Choices

1. Introduction

Project Title: Eco-Track Web: Sustainable Consumer Choices
Purpose: To develop a web application that empowers consumers to make informed and sustainable purchasing decisions.
Target Audience: Environmentally conscious consumers seeking to reduce their environmental footprint.
2. Goals and Objectives

Main Objective:
Empower consumers to make informed and sustainable purchasing decisions through a user-friendly web application.
Specific Objectives:
Enable barcode scanning to access environmental impact information.
Provide personalized eco-friendly recommendations.
Connect users with local recycling resources.
Educate users about sustainable consumption.
Create an accessible and engaging user interface.
3. Functional Requirements

3.1. Barcode Scanning and Product Information

FR1: Implement a barcode scanning feature using a JavaScript library (e.g., JSQR) that functions within the web browser.
FR2: Upon successful barcode scan, the application must query a product database (via API integration) to retrieve product information.
FR3: Display environmental impact information for the scanned product, including:
Carbon footprint (if available).
Material composition.
Recyclability information.
FR4: If product information is not found, display a "Product Not Found" message and provide an option for users to contribute product details.
3.2. Personalized Recommendations

FR5: Implement a user account system to store user preferences and purchase history.
FR6: Based on user preferences (e.g., dietary restrictions, preferred materials), generate personalized eco-friendly product recommendations.
FR7: Display recommendations based on purchase history in a dedicated section of the userâ€™s profile.
FR8: Allow users to rate and provide feedback on recommendations.
3.3. Recycling and Waste Management Resources

FR9: Integrate a map or directory to display local recycling centers, drop-off points, and waste management services.
FR10: Allow users to search for recycling resources by location or material type.
FR11: Display relevant information for each recycling resource, such as address, hours of operation, and accepted materials.
FR12: If possible, integrate with relevant recycling APIs to provide up to date information.
3.4. Educational Content

FR13: Create a section with articles, quizzes, and infographics on sustainable consumption practices.
FR14: Organize educational content by topic (e.g., reducing plastic waste, sustainable fashion).
FR15: Implement a search function to allow users to find specific educational content.
FR16: Track user engagement with educational content (e.g., quiz scores, articles read).
3.5. User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX)

FR17: Design a clean, intuitive, and mobile-responsive user interface.
FR18: Ensure accessibility for users with disabilities.
FR19: Implement a clear navigation structure.
FR20: Use consistent design elements and branding.
4. Non-Functional Requirements

NFR1: Performance: The application must load quickly and respond promptly to user interactions.
NFR2: Security: Protect user data and ensure secure transactions.
NFR3: Scalability: The application must be able to handle a growing number of users and data.
NFR4: Reliability: The application must be available and function correctly.
NFR5: Maintainability: The codebase should be well-organized and easy to maintain.
5. Tools and Technologies

Frontend: React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
Backend: Node.js, Express.js
Database: MongoDB or PostgreSQL
Barcode Scanning: JSQR (or similar)
API Integration: Product databases, recycling facility APIs
UI/UX Design: Figma, Adobe XD, or Canva
6. Stepwise Development Plan for Replit

Project Setup (Replit):
Create a new Replit project (Node.js or React template).
Set up version control (Git).
Frontend Development (React):
Create the basic UI structure using React components.
Implement the barcode scanning functionality.
Build the product information display.
Build the user profile pages.
Build the map/directory page.
Build the educational content pages.
Backend Development (Node.js/Express.js):
Set up the server and API endpoints.
Implement database connection.
Create API endpoints for product data retrieval.
Create API endpoints for user authentication and data storage.
Create API endpoints for recycling data retrieval.
Database Integration (MongoDB/PostgreSQL):
Design the database schema.
Implement database queries.
API Integration:
Integrate with product databases.
Integrate with recycling facility APIs.
Testing and Debugging:
Write unit tests and integration tests.
Debug and fix any issues.
UI/UX Refinement:
Refine the UI/UX based on user feedback.
Deployment (Replit or other platform):
Deploy the application.
Iterative Improvement:
Gather user feedback and make ongoing improvements.
7. Acceptance Criteria
